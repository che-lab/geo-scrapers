For Data Comm Final Project: Geoscraping South LA



I have figured out how to gather geocoding data for a location using the Google API. This gathers a JSON file with location data that we can convert to CSV for use in the project.

My contribution has been the Google API, using the key, and starting a python script that will take in a search term and location, and then spit out places relevant to the search term within an x mile radius of the input location.

I still need to finish that very python script.

I plan to have the python script implemented, and work with my team to figure out the initial location, the radius we want to explore, and what data (if not just latitude and longitude coordinates) we need to take from the JSON file and export to CSV for use in the project.
